# ZenTao Vulnerability Scanner

ZenTao Vulnerability Scanner is an automated security tool designed to detect and report potential vulnerabilities in ZenTao systems. It reads URLs from a file, checks each for specific vulnerabilities, and logs successful exploits to a CSV file.

## Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Automatically reads a list of URLs from a file and performs vulnerability scans.
- **Concurrency**: Supports concurrent scanning to improve efficiency.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates a CSV file with detailed results for further analysis.
- **Extensibility**: The codebase is structured for easy modifications and enhancements.

## Installation

This tool is written in Python and depends on the `requests` library. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system before you start.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/zentao-vulnerability-scanner.git
cd zentao-vulnerability-scanner

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Save your list of target URLs in a text file, one URL per line.
2. Run the scanner using the command:

```bash
python zentao_vuln_scanner.py -f path/to/your/urls.txt
```

## File Structure

- `zentao_vuln_scanner.py`: The main script containing all the scanning logic.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python libraries that the project depends on.
- `result.csv`: The scan results will be logged to this CSV file.
